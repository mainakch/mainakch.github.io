Interests
---------

My primary interests are in the theory, practice and art of wireless system design, from the baseband all the way to the application layer.

In addition, I have worked on various problems in convex optimization, computer networking, timing channels, time synchronization and indoor positioning.  I am also interested in precision medicine, digital health and startups.  I believe that inter-disciplinary cross-pollination of ideas is a powerful catalyst for innovation.

Brief Bio
---------

I am a co-founder at [ZaiNar]({% post_url 2022-06-05-zainar %}), where I served primarily as the Wireless Systems Architect until May 2, 2022.  Prior to this, I was a Senior Engineer at [Cohere Technologies]({% post_url 2018-01-31-cohere %}).

I spent six wonderful years in the MS/PhD (Electrical Engineering) program at [Stanford University](https://ee.stanford.edu) with [Andrea Goldsmith](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/andrea-goldsmith) as my primary advisor. My [PhD thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12137362) is on noncoherent energy-detection-based communications for massive MIMO systems.  During my PhD, I was involved with [ImpriMed](http://www.imprimedicine.com), which is now offering assays for personalizing pet cancer treatment.

My undergraduate studies were in [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in) where I majored in Electrical Engineering. My BTech project advisor was [Ajit Chaturvedi](https://www.iitr.ac.in/institute/pages/Director_IIT_Roorkee.html). Before that, I went to [South Point High School](https://www.southpoint.edu.in/) in my hometown of Kolkata, India.
