Interests
---------

My primary interests are in the theory, practice and art of wireless systems for communications, sensing and prediction, leveraging both computational (including, but not limited to [AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)) and mathematical tools.  I am interested in all [layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Layer_8) of the systems I work on.

I am also interested in building trustworthy distributed systems.

I relish the opportunity to work with [creative](https://paulgraham.com/newthings.html) (but not necessarily visionary or disruptive) problem solvers across disciplines.

Brief Bio
---------

I am currently building trustworthy distributed systems for various emerging verticals. 

Previously, I was a Member of Technical Staff within [Bell Labs](https://www.bell-labs.com/).  Prior to that, I served as the Wireless Systems Architect and a Software Lead at [ZaiNar]({% post_url 2022-06-05-zainar %}), before which I served as a Senior Engineer at [Cohere Technologies](https://www.cohere-tech.com).  I spent six wonderful years in the MS/PhD (Electrical Engineering) program at [Stanford University](https://ee.stanford.edu) with [Andrea Goldsmith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Goldsmith_(engineer)) as my primary advisor. My [PhD thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12137362) is on noncoherent energy-detection-based communications for massive MIMO systems.  During my PhD, I was involved with [ImpriMed](http://www.imprimedicine.com), which is now offering assays for personalizing pet cancer treatment.

My undergraduate studies were in [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in) where I majored in Electrical Engineering. My BTech project advisor was [Ajit Chaturvedi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajit_Kumar_Chaturvedi). Before that, I went to [South Point High School](https://www.southpoint.edu.in/) in my hometown of Kolkata, India.
