Interests
---------

My primary interests are in the theory, practice and art of wireless systems for communications, sensing and prediction.  I am interested in all layers of the protocol stack, from the physical layer all the way to the application layer.

I am also interested in the theory and applications of optimization, statistics and computer networking, and in digital health and precision medicine.

If you are interested in working with me, let's connect!  I relish the opportunity to work with creative problem solvers across disciplines.

Brief Bio
---------

I am a Member of Technical Staff at the Radio Systems Research Group within [Bell Labs Core Research](https://www.bell-labs.com/institute/blog/accelerating-a-new-era-of-research-innovation-at-nokia-bell-labs) where I am involved in 6G research with a focus on wireless sensing and distributed systems.

Previously, I served as a Wireless Systems Architect and a Software Lead at [ZaiNar]({% post_url 2022-06-05-zainar %}), prior to which I served as a Senior Engineer at [Cohere Technologies](https://www.cohere-tech.com).  Before that, I spent six wonderful years in the MS/PhD (Electrical Engineering) program at [Stanford University](https://ee.stanford.edu) with [Andrea Goldsmith](https://ece.princeton.edu/people/andrea-goldsmith) as my primary advisor. My [PhD thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12137362) is on noncoherent energy-detection-based communications for massive MIMO systems.  During my PhD, I was involved with [ImpriMed](http://www.imprimedicine.com), which is now offering assays for personalizing pet cancer treatment.

My undergraduate studies were in [IIT Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in) where I majored in Electrical Engineering. My BTech project advisor was [Ajit Chaturvedi](https://www.iitr.ac.in/institute/pages/Director_IIT_Roorkee.html). Before that, I went to [South Point High School](https://www.southpoint.edu.in/) in my hometown of Kolkata, India.
