_A ray tracing simulator for my research on massive MIMO (C)_

<!--more-->

This simulator was used to generate the plots in Chapter 5 of my [PhD thesis](https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/12137362).  The current [implementation](https://github.com/mainakch/wireless_link) is in the C programming language and is mainly meant for experimental/research use.  

A port to C++ and an official release is being planned for the near future.  Stay tuned!
