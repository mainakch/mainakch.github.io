In this work, we study the diversity in one-shot communication over molecular timing channels.  We find that simple detectors based on order statistics (e.g., first arrival) can come close to the maximum-likelihood decoder in terms of performance.  A preview version of this work appeared in the 2016 IEEE Global Communications Conference.
