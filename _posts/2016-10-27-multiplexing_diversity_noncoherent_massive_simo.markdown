We study the tradeoffs between diversity (related to decoding error probability) and multiplexing (related to the number of simultaneous users) inherent in a single-input multiple-output (SIMO) system with a large number of antennas.  We find that, even without channel state information, given a large enough number of antennas, multiuser detection may be performed with a vanishingly small error probability.  A conference version of this work appeared in the 2015 49th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems and Computers.
