_A tool designed to perform optimization with a piecewise-linear or piecewise-quadratic approximation to general functions (python)_

<!--more-->

This [tool](https://github.com/mainakch/cvxfit) fits a convex approximation to general functions using function values evaluated at some points in the domain and then uses standard solvers to solve the resulting problem.  This was done as a class project in [EE364b](https://web.stanford.edu/class/ee364b/).
