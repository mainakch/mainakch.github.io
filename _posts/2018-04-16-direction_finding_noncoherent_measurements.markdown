In this work, fundamental limits are derived on the angle-of-arrival estimation error (using energy measurements from each antenna element) from an asymptotic study of the Fisher information matrix in the limit of a large number of antennas.  Our analysis and simulations show that the estimation error goes down as the inverse cube of the number of antennas.
