We study the scaling behavior of channel capacity as both the bandwidth and the number of antennas scale to infinity jointly, assuming a fixed coherence time and transmit power.  Our analysis shows that bandwidth increase helps with channel capacity only up to a certain threshold, after which there are no benefits to the capacity scaling. A conference version of this work was presented at the 2015 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW).
