We present constellation designs based on energy detection for multiuser single-input multiple-output (SIMO) systems with a large number of “output” antennas.  Based on our performance analysis and simulations we see that multi-user detection can be done with a vanishingly small error probability if the number of antennas is high enough.  The conference version of this manuscript was a finalist for the Globecom 2014 Best Paper Award (top **2.5%** of submitted manuscripts that year).
