In this demo paper we present a dynamic spectrum-level slicing (DSLS) implementation for heterogeneous networks based on an open source software/hardware platform known as OpenAirInterface. Assuming the network traffic load changes every time interval, we mathematically formulate the DSLS as an optimization problem with the corresponding sets of constraints.
