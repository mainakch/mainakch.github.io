We perform a sensitivity analysis on the expected utility of adding storage capacity in a wind energy producer system, under very general assumptions on stochastic behavior of the wind.    Our analysis reveals optimal policies for using the battery.  A conference version of this work appeared in the 2015 American Control Conference.
