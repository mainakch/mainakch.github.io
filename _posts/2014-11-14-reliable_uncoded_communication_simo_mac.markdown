<!--more-->
We consider a multiuser single-input multiple-output multiple access channel with each user transmitting from a discrete constellation.  We show that, reliable communication (with the decoding error probability per user being arbitrarily low) can be supported even with the number of antennas at the output being a vanishingly small fraction of the number of users in the system.  Moreover, convex optimization-based relaxations to maximum likelihood decoder are sufficient towards achieving these results.
