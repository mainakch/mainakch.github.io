_A mobile filesystem over a custom UDP protocol for roaming networks (python)_

<!--more-->

This project aims at addressing known shortcomings of the `sshfs` program which operates over TCP.  The "proof-of-concept" [implementation](https://github.com/mainakch/mobilefs) is in [Python 2](https://www.python.org).

A port to C++ and an official release is being planned for the near future.  Stay tuned!
