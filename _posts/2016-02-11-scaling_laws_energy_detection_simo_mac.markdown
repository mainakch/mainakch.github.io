We show that in multiuser single-input multipe-output (SIMO) systems with a large number of antennas, the channel capacity scale the same way regardless of whether channel state information is present or not.  Achievability and converse results are presented.  Given the challenges inherent in acquiring channel state information, these results suggest significant benefits to be had by considering non-coherent architectures for Massive MIMO systems.  Earlier versions of this work appeared in the 2014 48th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS), and in the 2014 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory.
