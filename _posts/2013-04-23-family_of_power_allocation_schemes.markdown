<!--more-->
We consider a spectrum-sharing OFDM cognitive radio system, and describe a family of power-allocation schemes towards achieving high secondary user rates while ensuring rate guarantees for primary users.  Our proposal allows trading off individual guarantees for primary user rates for higher secondary user sum rates.  

This work was part of my BTech project and was done in collaboration with Anubhav Singla and Ajit Chaturvedi.
