We study the system-level effects of introducing large populations of electric vehicles on power and transportation networks under the constraint that the operational data inside each of the two networks are kept private.  We propose a scheme by which both these networks can be kept at a social optimum.  We also find that ignoring these interdependencies between the two networks can lead to instabilities.
